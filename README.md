Flappy Bird Clone


A simple flappy bird clone written in Java during a couple of my lunch breaks at work.  Will use this as my basis to learn android app development.


TO DO, AS OF MAY  23,2014:
Randomly generated pipes.
Collission detection.
Score keeper.
Sprite animations.
Title screen.
High score keeper.
Android port(eventually).
